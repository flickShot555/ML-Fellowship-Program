# Machine Learning Utility Functions

This repository contains implementations of key machine learning mathematical functions, including:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Cosine Similarity
- Linear Regression (Least Squares Method)
- Softmax Function

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Functions Explained

## 📌 Functions Included

- ✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE) - Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- ✅ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - Square root of MSE for better interpretability.
- ✅ Cosine Similarity - Computes the similarity between two vectors.
- ✅ Linear Regression - Uses the Least Squares Method to find the best fit line.
- ✅ Softmax Function - Converts raw scores into probabilities.

## 📖 Function Usage

### 1️⃣ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Computes the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
```python
mse = mean_squared_error(actual, predicted);
```

### 2️⃣ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Computes the square root of MSE for better interpretability.
```python
rmse = root_mean_squared_error(actual, predicted)
```

### 3️⃣ Cosine Similarity
Measures similarity between two vectors.
```python
similarity = cosine_similarity(vector_a, vector_b)
```

### 4️⃣ Linear Regression
Computes slope and intercept for a linear model.
```python
slope, intercept = linear_regression(x_values, y_values)
```

### 5️⃣ Softmax Function
Converts a list of values into probabilities.
```python
probabilities = softmax(values)
```

## 🚀 How to Use
Simply import the functions and call them with appropriate input lists.

```python
from ml_fellowship_program import mean_squared_error, root_mean_squared_error, cosine_similarity, linear_regression, softmax
```
