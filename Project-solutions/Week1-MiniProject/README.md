- Validates email format.

### 2️⃣ Even or Odd?
- Checks if a given number is even or odd.
- Uses the modulo (`%`) operator.

### 3️⃣ Temperature Converter
- Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Uses a function to handle conversions.

### 4️⃣ Finding Min & Max
- Takes 5 numbers as input from the user.
- Finds and displays the minimum and maximum values.

### 5️⃣ Student Data Manager
- Collects details of 3 students.
- Stores data as tuples in a dictionary.

### 6️⃣ Inventory Management System
