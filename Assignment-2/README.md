## Functions & Descriptions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Mean, Median & Mode Calculation**
- **Mean:** The average of numbers.
- **Median:** The middle value in sorted numbers.
- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring number(s).

```python
calculate_mean(numbers)
calculate_median(numbers)
calculate_mode(numbers)
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Variance Calculation
Measures how spread out numbers are.
```python
calculate_variance(numbers)
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Deviation Calculation
Measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
```python
calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Euclidean Distance Calculation
Distance between two points in Euclidean space.
```python
calculate_euclidean_distance(point1, point2)
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Sigmoid Function
Converts any value to a value between 0 and 1.
```python
sigmoid(x)
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Example Usage
```python
numbers = [4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 8, 9]

print("Mean:", calculate_mean(numbers))
print("Median:", calculate_median(numbers))
print("Mode:", calculate_mode(numbers))
print("Variance:", calculate_variance(numbers))
print("Standard Deviation:", calculate_standard_deviation(numbers))

print("Euclidean Distance:", euclidean_distance([3, 4], [0, 0]))
print("Sigmoid of 2:", sigmoid(2))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the provided functions to calculate various statistical measures and mathematical operations. The example usage at the end showcases how to use these functions with sample data.
